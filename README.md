# Real-Time Volleyball Action Detection Using Machine Learning

This project presents a system for **real-time volleyball action detection** using **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques. The goal is to automatically detect and classify key volleyball actions such as **setting, bumping, and attacking** from video footage with **low latency** and **high accuracy**, making it suitable for practical use during training sessions and games.
